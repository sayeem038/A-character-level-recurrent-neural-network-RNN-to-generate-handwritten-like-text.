# Project Name : 
HANDWRITTEN TEXT GENERATION WITH DEEP LEARNING

# Objective: 
- Implement a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to
generate handwritten-like text. Train the model on a dataset of
handwritten text examples, and let it generate new text based on
the learned patterns.
# Step:
Step 1: Set Up Your Colab Environment Open Google Colab: Go to Google Colab.

Step 2: Import Necessary Libraries Start by importing the necessary libraries.

Step 3: Load and Preprocess the Dataset Download the Dataset: Download the IAM Handwriting Database from Papers with Code.

Step 4: Define the Model Define an RNN model using LSTM.

Step 5: Train the Model Train the model and save checkpoints.

Step 6: Generate Text Load the trained model and generate new text.

Then, We will get The final result.
